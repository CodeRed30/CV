An agile Full Stack Developer who used the opportunity of a career break to retrain. No stranger to a challenge and with a passion for problem solving, I have been successful in transitioning my skill set under the training and guidance of Makers Academy. My experience has given me the ability to excel in fast paced and demanding environments and with my enthusiasm for learning and development, I am always looking to challenge myself and learn something new. A diligent team player with the capacity to lead, I am excited to find my next team to build and grow with. I’m looking to return to full time work after 2 years of caring for my mother.

## Skills

#### Grit and Determination

Never one to let an obstacle get the better of me, I work diligently to fix bugs and issues in the code base and often volunteer to support other members of the cohort attempt to fix their code too. Prior to Makers, I taught myself web builder technologies and basic HTML and CSS to ensure I could still work while caring.

#### Communication

A clear and direct communicator, I have a daily blog to reflect on my learning experience and aid my capacity to explain key concepts to those without a technical background. Managing multi-national projects while at Peakon required me to be a coherent and concise leader whilst ensuring nobody was left behind.

#### Self Led Learner

Makers developed my capacity to ensure learning is a lifelong skill. Since completing the course I have decided to begin learning Python, React and Cypress.

#### Resourcefulness

Known as the librarian of the cohort, I try hard to find, save and also share the best learning resources that help me understand the new concepts we were learning. Working for MassChallenge - a non-profit - I developed my resourcefulness skills to run a large programme with limited time, space, team and budget.
